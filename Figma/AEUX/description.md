## AEUX - HOOK STUDIOS INTERNAL VERSION

AEUX helps you move designs from Figma to After Effects. 

### What it does:

*  Sends Figma layers to After Effects while keeping their look and organization.
*  Makes sure your shapes, text, colors, and effects look the same in After Effects.
*  Works with different types of layers like shapes, vectors, and text.

### How to use it:

1. **Select your layers in Figma.** 
2. **Click the "Send selection to Ae" button in the plugin window.** 
3. **The layers will show up in After Effects, ready for you to animate.**


**Additional Options:**

*  **Export reference image:** This creates a PNG of your Figma design as a reference in After Effects.
*  **Rasterize layer on export:** This marks layers with a "\*" to indicate they should be turned into PNGs.

**That's it! Now you can easily take your Figma designs and animate them in After Effects.**
